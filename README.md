cpp study
=========

I haven't coded in c++ for over 20 years!!  forgot all about it and it is now time for me to revisit and reshape up my c++ skills :-P
so, this won't be suitable for anyone who are new to c++ because I won't include any explanations like how the comments work, how to write a code or whatever...

but if you are person like me and forgot all about c++, then please enjoy~
goal is to go over as quickly as possible to refresh anyone's forgotten c++ skills and hopefully create some good example codes.

I am using Linux Ubuntu.  So, please keep that in mind.
And make sure you have gcc and g++ installed.
